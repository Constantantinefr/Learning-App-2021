# Unit-Circle-Game
  The Unit Circle Game is a tool to help students memorize the essential parts of the Unit Circle. The application includes both a "learn mode" and a "quiz mode." The learn mode includes an interactive unit circle. Students can expand certain sections of the unit circle to learn about each section's properties such as their radians, degrees, and coordinates. The Quiz Mode is filled with basic questions about the Unit Circle. Users of the Quiz Mode will be given a value which could be degree measures, radian measures, or coordinates and will be asked to match this value with the corresponding value found in the answer choices. Users can use the "continue" button to cycle through questions. The app will automatically track how many answers a user has got right in a row and will display this value along with the user's highest streak of correct answers.
